**Question:** What weighs more: 20 pounds of bricks or 20 feathers?

***

### Problem Analysis

This is a classic riddle that plays on our intuition about the properties of different objects. To solve it, we must focus only on the information given in the question and ignore our preconceived notions about the individual items (a single brick vs. a single feather).

**Step 1: Identify the key information.**
The question provides two quantities to compare:
*   The weight of the bricks is **20 pounds**.
*   The weight of the feathers is **20 pounds**.

**Step 2: Identify the unit of measurement.**
The unit used for comparison is **pounds**. A pound is a standard unit of weight.

**Step 3: Compare the given weights.**
The weight of the bricks is 20 pounds.
The weight of the feathers is 20 pounds.
Therefore, 20 pounds is equal to 20 pounds.

**Conclusion:**
Neither weighs more. **They weigh exactly the same.**

The trick in the question lies in the difference between weight, volume, and density. While 20 pounds of bricks would take up a very small space (high density), 20 pounds of feathers would take up a very large space (low density). Our minds instinctively think of a single brick being much heavier than a single feather, but the question has already equalized the weight for us.
