What weighs more: 20 pounds of bricks or 20 feathers?

Let's carefully analyze the question. The question asks for a comparison of weight between "20 pounds of bricks" and "20 feathers." 

First, let's consider "20 pounds of bricks." The phrase explicitly states the weight as 20 pounds, so we know that the bricks weigh 20 pounds in total.

Next, let's look at "20 feathers." The phrase specifies a quantity of 20 feathers but does not provide a weight. Feathers are known to be very light, with a single feather typically weighing only a fraction of a gram. Even if we estimate the weight of one feather to be about 0.05 grams (a reasonable average for a bird feather), the total weight of 20 feathers would be 20 Ã— 0.05 grams = 1 gram. Converting this to pounds, since 1 pound is approximately 453.6 grams, 1 gram is roughly 0.0022 pounds. This is an extremely small weight, negligible compared to 20 pounds.

Now, comparing the two: 20 pounds of bricks clearly weighs 20 pounds, while 20 feathers weigh approximately 0.0022 pounds. Therefore, 20 pounds of bricks weigh significantly more than 20 feathers.

One might wonder if there is a trick in the question, such as a typo or misinterpretation of "20 feathers" as "20 pounds of feathers." However, the question is written as "20 feathers," not "20 pounds of feathers," so we must take it at face value. Additionally, even if feathers from larger birds or different contexts were considered, their weight would still be far less than 20 pounds.

Thus, the answer is clear. 20 pounds of bricks weigh more than 20 feathers.
