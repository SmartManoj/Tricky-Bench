Let me repeat the question exactly:

"What weighs more: 20 pounds of bricks or 20 feathers?"

Now let me work through this carefully:

The question asks about:
- 20 pounds of bricks
- 20 feathers

Wait, I need to read more carefully. The question actually asks about:
- 20 pounds of bricks
- 20 feathers (not 20 pounds of feathers)

This is the key distinction. We have:
- Bricks: 20 pounds (a specific weight)
- Feathers: 20 individual feathers (a specific count, not weight)

20 individual feathers would weigh very little - perhaps a few grams or a fraction of an ounce at most.

Therefore, 20 pounds of bricks weighs significantly more than 20 feathers.
