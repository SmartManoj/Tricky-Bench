## Answer:

"What weighs more: 20 pounds of bricks or 20 feathers?"

The question specifies **20 pounds of bricks** (a weight measurement) versus **20 feathers** (a count of individual feathers). To compare them, we need to determine the total weight of the 20 feathers. Assuming an average feather weighs about 0.001 pounds (or roughly 0.01 ounces), 20 feathers would total approximately **0.02 pounds**.

Thus, **20 pounds of bricks** (20 lbs) weighs significantly more than **20 feathers** (~0.02 lbs).

The classic riddle "Which weighs more: a pound of feathers or a pound of bricks?" hinges on equal weights (both 1 lb), but this question is different. Here, the feathers are not measured in pounds of weight but in quantity.

**Answer:** 20 pounds of bricks weigh more.
